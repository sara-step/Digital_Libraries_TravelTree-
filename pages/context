##About This Collection## 
This project aims to digitize a personal collection of ornaments and keychains gathered during travels. All items will be sourced from a dedicated travel tree, a Christmas tree adorned with these cherished mementos, and photographed for archival purposes. The end result will be a comprehensive digital record featuring high-quality images and rich metadata for each ornament and keychain. This data will facilitate the creation of a user-friendly website that maps these items, allowing for easy browsing and exploration of the collection.
