# Collection Context
## About This Project
This project aims to digitize a personal collection of ornaments and keychains gathered during travels. All items will be sourced from a dedicated travel tree, a Christmas tree adorned with these cherished mementos, and photographed for archival purposes. The end result will be a comprehensive digital record featuring high-quality images and rich metadata for each ornament and keychain. This data will facilitate the creation of a user-friendly website that maps these items, allowing for easy browsing and exploration of the collection.

## Content 
This collection features 32 keychains and ornaments from various travel destinations, landmarks, and attractions across the United States, the Caribbean, and Europe. Each item will be digitized using high-quality photographs to ensure detailed representation and preservation.

## Users
 It is anticipated that this project will primarily be used by Sarah Stephensons, the owner of the Travel Tree ornaments, and the creation of this project as this project is based on her personal travel experiences. The digital collection will serve as a resource for Sarah to reflect on her journeys and the memories associated with each ornament and keychain. Additionally, potential secondary users could include friends and family members Sarah traveled with, who may find value in exploring the collection and reminiscing about shared experiences.
